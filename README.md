# Meddibuddy-Project
MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform for an inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits.

This project analyzes MediBuddy's health insurance data by merging two datasets: one containing pre-policy health checkup details such as age and BMI, and another with personal attributes including gender, number of dependents, smoking habits, and geographic region. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we investigate key factors influencing insurance claims.

Key insights reveal whether gender plays a role in policy constraints, the average amount spent per policy, and whether regional differences necessitate separate insurance policies. We also assess how the number of dependents, BMI, smoking status, and age impact claim amounts, identifying patterns that may influence policy pricing and risk assessment.

Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of offering health-based discounts, particularly for individuals with a lower BMI. These insights enable MediBuddy to refine its insurance offerings, optimize pricing models, and enhance customer engagement.

In addition to the analytical findings, a machine learning model is developed to predict insurance claim amounts with high accuracy. The model undergoes hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for premium adjustments and policy customization.
